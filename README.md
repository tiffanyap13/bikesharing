## Summary
### Results
The data reveals that men are most likely to rent the Citi Bikes, for what appears to be usage during rush hour and for leisure on the weekends. There is an opportunity to increase the daily usage by females and also usage by all during the middle of the workdays, Monday - Friday.  
### Additional Recommendations
Two additional visualizations that could be brought into the analysis are: bike rental based on age and also the end station locations. The age data would be interesting to review and have a full picture of rental demographics. Regarding the end station location, it would be interesting to see how many bikes were returned to their pick-up location.
